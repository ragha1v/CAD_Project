10.) python3 manage.py runserver- It will run our manage.py file on the server and allocate an ip and port on which our website can be accessed. By default it allocates 127.0.0.1:8080 but we can modify it by running a command : python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 like this we can give it any ip and port and change the security groups to custom tcp & port to that range which you are allocating.
